# Open Book
This is website that allows users to anonymously write a public diary that others can read. Users create an account to post on and have the ability to "Snoop" others' profiles.


## Running the Project Locally
- make sure you have Node Package Manager Installed
- `git clone https://github.com/TJH2/open_book_react`
- open 2 terminals
- in terminal 1, navigate to the server folder and run `npm install`
- in terminal 2, navigate to the client folder and run `npm install`
- next, run `npm dev` in *both* terminals, the server folder terminal first
- If it all works you'll see the website at `http://localhost:5173/`
